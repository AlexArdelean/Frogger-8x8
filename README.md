# Frogger-8x8

I created frogger using a joystick and an 8x8 led matrix. Cross a river using moving logs and lily pads, and dodge cars to cross a street. Before passing to the next level you also need to grab an item. 

Written in C using Atmel studio IDE.

Features:
  * Every level is completely randomly generated.
  * Lily pads disappear after some time when standing on one.
